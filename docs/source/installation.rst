Installation
============

Type the following at your terminal to install **eppy**

::

	pip install eppy

Go to http://www.numpy.org and install NumPy.

.. I have disabled the install of NumPy through "pip install eppy", since it was not reliable

Go to  http://www.graphviz.org and install graphviz

*Note: eppy runs on python2 and python 3.*
