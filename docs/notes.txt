updated notes on publishing the documentation.

1. main docs
- ipython notebook to make the docs in ./docs
- ipython nbconvert --to rst ../*.ipynb # run from ./docs/source
- put the rst file names in index.rst

2. developer docs
- ipython notebook to make the docs in ./docs/source/dev_docs/
- ipython nbconvert --to rst ./*.ipynb # run from ./docs/source/dev_docs/
- put the rst file names in index.rst

- set the correct version number in ./source/conf.py
- make html # run from ./docs
- correct any errors
- git push to remote
- goto <https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/> and build docs again

notes on reducing rst errors from ipython notebook
- instead of multiple lines do multiple paragraphs
- indent raw text

Steps for release
- make notes in docs/source/changes.rst
- 
- establish a release number (0.4.6)
- change the release number in the documentation. (in .docs/source/conf.py)
- change version number in ./eppy/eppy/__init__.py
- rebuild the documentation
-
- upload code to pypi
    - python setup.py sdist upload
- install from pypi in virtualenv. eplus_sphinx (or eppy_sphinx)
    - pip install --upgrade eppy 
    - this is needed so that code api is there
- rebuild the documentation
- upload documentation to pypi 
python setup.py upload_docs --upload-dir=docs/generated
-
- push to github
- git tag r0.46
- git push origin r0.46
- make a release on github with a new tag = release number

notes on reducing rst errors from ipython notebook
- indent raw text, add :: in preceding markdown
- if markdown has extraneous whitespace will trigger an explicit markup and ::      will not work
- raw text after code (with no results) will appear in same cell as code insert     :: cell between

to make html of the tutorials do:
ipython nbconvert --to html *.ipynb
ipython nbconvert --to html ../*.ipynb # run from ./docs/generated
ipython nbconvert --to rst ../*.ipynb # run from ./docs/generated
ipython nbconvert --to rst ../*.ipynb # run from ./docs/source

the Tutorial is built up in the ipython notebook file -> tutorial.ipynb
tutorial.ipynb imports from eppy. 
This import can be done only if eppy is installed in an virtual env.
Otherwise I'll have to hardcode the path names in the not the example code

The following lines describe how to install eppy to use while writing the tutorial
- make a new virtualenv -> eppytutorial (need to do only once)
- install ipython notebook (need to do only once)
    - easy_install ipython[all]
- install eppy in it (need to do only once - see notes below)
- do > workon eppytutorial
- workon tutorial
- cd docs
- ipython notebook (and you are ready to edit the docs in ipython)
- 


installing the most current eppy
- workon eppytutorial
- pip uninstall eppy (not needed first time)
- make an eppy egg
    - python setup.py sdist
    -   
    - pip install ../dist/eppy-0.4.0.tar.gz 
        (version number may be different - check)
    - rm -r ../dist
    - rm -r ../eppy.egg-info
