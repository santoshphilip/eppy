on testing with issue13 updates, ony three files could not be read:
['./issue13/LookupTables.idf', 
    './issue13/RefrigeratedWarehouse.idf',
    './issue13/RetailPackagedTESCoil.idf']
this is because they have the object "TABLE:MULTIVARIABLELOOKUP" 
This object can be read in version 8.1 onwards.
Now the code will have to check the version :-( for backward compatibility
How and where can I do that.

issue 13
see slashcomment.py
fixed by change in parse_idd
test by converting files in example set and comaring input and output.
Do this using master and branch issue13

working towards release 0.4.5
- update the fixed idd file version 8.
- update docs for new changes
- include function docs in sphinx
- release on git hub and on pypi

l = [1,2,3]
pop -> popidfobject(index)
remove -> removeidfobject(idfobject)
append -> appendidfobject(idfobject)
newidfobject(key) will append a brand new idf object

pytest will go above the last folder with __init__.py for an import
This will make the imports work correctly.

2013-09-21

keep the remaining docs (loops and readhtml)
focus on development. 

2013-09-21

made branch -> almost_master
This shouuld really be master, but I am not sure.
made brancch -> develop (made it now)
All development should be done here

TODO 
- tutorial for condensor loop and airside loop
- seperate tutorial on readhtml
- nedd a function that will do:
	idf.idfobjects[key].pop(0)
- 
- articulate the thinking on the software orgainzation.
	- the core code deals only with objects and fields
	- readhtml is a seperate package (for output reading)
	- buildhvac would be a seperate package
	-
	- these packages would have seperate tutorials

I think d_newread.py is working. 
Reads idd only once.

IIDF now reads idd only once
it works with iddfilename, but not with iddfilehandle :-(
see d_newread.py
compare theidd (from readidf.readdatacommdct) in d_newread.py and d_filehandle.py

- IDF.setiddname(fhandle)
    this is failing because, fhandle is getting exhausted
    fhandle should get used only once. - how to do this ?
moke the pipe objects.
check if a new object can be made with named arguments. DONE

when you rename nodes do:
obj.nodefield = [oldnodename, newodename]
Then you can find the occurance of the old names in other places.

node rename
- exception at loop endpoints.
- How to identify them.
updatebranch(loop, branch, [c1, c2, c3, c4])
getinletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
getoutletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
do standard node name change
If None:
    replace that nodename
else:
    pass

[p0, p1] -> [pn, p0, p1]
[p0, p1] -> [p0, p1, pn]
[p0, p1, p2] -> [p0, pn, p1, p2]

OR

replace the contents of the branch with a new list of components
[pump, chiller, coil] -> these items are EpBunch objects.
two options:
- rename all the nodes logically. 
    - 
    Problem is that nodes may be referred to at the controls.
