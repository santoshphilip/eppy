----------
write a script that will track all the references from the idd_info.
look at this to see what function must be written to wrap over getreferingobjs

- open an issue for all this code.

write function to return all the surfaces of a zone
This is a generic problem in eppy:
- return all the subsurfaces of a surface
- return all the objects that use a schedule
- etc

So write a more generic function that will work with 'object-list' and 'reference' (as described in the idd file)

write code to get the list of zone surfaces. - DONE
abstract this into generic code. 

2016-06-11
----------
- idd2groups is built and tested
- groups are embedded into commdct
- extract glist from commdct - DONE

maybe do the following:
    - now explore idd_parse to understand what it is doing. 
    - maybe use this as a way to rebuild parse_idd.extractidddata
    - call "block" -> "field"


2016-06-03
----------
access the idf in epbunch - DONE
trace surfaces of walls.
    - reference give another name for key.
        to find a reference, search all key.Name.reference
would be nice to do 
    - wall.Name.idd['reference']
    - OR -> wall.getidd(fieldname)['reference']
wall.Zone_Name.idd['object-list'] -> ZoneNames
search
    [value[0]. for key, value in idfobjects.items() if len(value) != 0]
refname2key(idf, refname)

- would be nice to have the group data in idd_info
    - either put it into the idddata
    or
    - have a separate data structure
- without the group data, the relavant lists have to be made by hand
- make a new branch to test this ?
- branch - brazil_iddgroups
data structure
{'group 1 name':[k1, k2, k3, k4], 'grout2':[k5, k6, k7], }
{k1:g1, k2:g2, k3:g3}
OR
objidd = [{"group":"gname", ...}, {... }, ....]

idd2groups is built - now where do I use it ?

Notes for Eric.
git checkout develop
git branch dtemp
git checkout dtemp
-
- put MIT license in new files
- added some imports from __future__
- ran 2t03 conversions
- added test_height_surface.py
- ran pylint on new files (except tinynumpy)
    - Eric, run pylint on test_tinydnarray



2015-05-26

Have a toggle that can force the line endings
idf.save(lineendings='default')
idf.saveas(fname, lineendings='default')

eppy can read fields dos path names with backslash '\' 
2014-08-04
----------
ran test for checking if eppy is reading all example files.
on a mac under EnergyPlus-8-1-0, the following files failed the read:

- 12 False 4ZoneWithShading_Simple_1.idf
- 13 False 4ZoneWithShading_Simple_2.idf
the above two files used a keyword "End Lead Input" 
the keyword was not in the IDD file. So it failed

- 168 False EMSUserDefined5ZoneAirCooled.idf
- 169 False EMSUserDefinedWindACAuto.idf
- 225 False HospitalBaselineReheatReportEMS.idf
- 355 False RetailPackagedTESCoil.idf
the above 4 files used extended fields
while testing the idd did not have the extended fields
So they failed

2013-12-21
----------
on testing with issue13 updates, ony three files could not be read:
['./issue13/LookupTables.idf', 
    './issue13/RefrigeratedWarehouse.idf',
    './issue13/RetailPackagedTESCoil.idf']
this is because they have the object "TABLE:MULTIVARIABLELOOKUP" 
This object can be read in version 8.1 onwards.
Now the code will have to check the version :-( for backward compatibility
How and where can I do that.
2013-12-20
----------
issue 13
see slashcomment.py
fixed by change in parse_idd
test by converting files in example set and comaring input and output.
Do this using master and branch issue13
2013-12-11
----------
working towards release 0.4.5
- update the fixed idd file version 8.
- update docs for new changes
- include function docs in sphinx
- release on git hub and on pypi


2013-10-03
----------
l = [1,2,3]
pop -> popidfobject(index)
remove -> removeidfobject(idfobject)
append -> appendidfobject(idfobject)
newidfobject(key) will append a brand new idf object

2013-09-24
----------
pytest will go above the last folder with __init__.py for an import
This will make the imports work correctly.

2013-09-21
----------
keep the remaining docs (loops and readhtml)
focus on development. 

2013-09-21
----------
made branch -> almost_master
This shouuld really be master, but I am not sure.
made brancch -> develop (made it now)
All development should be done here

TODO 
- tutorial for condensor loop and airside loop
- seperate tutorial on readhtml
- nedd a function that will do:
	idf.idfobjects[key].pop(0)
- 
- articulate the thinking on the software orgainzation.
	- the core code deals only with objects and fields
	- readhtml is a seperate package (for output reading)
	- buildhvac would be a seperate package
	-
	- these packages would have seperate tutorials

when you rename nodes do:
obj.nodefield = [oldnodename, newodename]
Then you can find the occurance of the old names in other places.

node rename

- How to identify them.
updatebranch(loop, branch, [c1, c2, c3, c4])
getinletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
getoutletname(loop, branch, c1) -> maybe None
do standard node name change
If None:
    replace that nodename
else:

OR

replace the contents of the branch with a new list of components
[pump, chiller, coil] -> these items are EpBunch objects.
two options:
- rename all the nodes logically. 
    - 
    Problem is that nodes may be referred to at the controls.
