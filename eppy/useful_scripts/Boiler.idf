! This input file is intended to replace the other way of doing things which
! has a larger number of input files, one for each configuration of primary and
! secondary heating, and availability or otherwise of storage.
!
! For heaters and emitters, presence or absence is set by modifying the size of
! components. If they are not available for heating then they are sized to 0 W.
! If storage is not available (e.g. for a combi boiler) then the water heater
! volume is set to approx. 3 litres as recommended by EnergyPlus documentation.
