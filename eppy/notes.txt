need a default setting for idd (maybe the latest one)
open a new file -> IDF.initnew() -> DONE

Notes for conf call
- all functionality complete.
- documentation complete (more complex examples should be included)
- plant loop is done (a ir loop and condenser loop not yet done - plant loop was non trivial)

to be done:
install instructions needed.


2013-06-21
----------
using idd version 8.0.0
had to remove non-unicode chars in the idd file
passes all unittest after minor change in one test

notes for conf call

all tasks for completion of project
- update docs
- HVAC loop Builder (at component, branch and loop level)
- finish up remaining functions (rename, any others ?, comment in save)

Tasks done:
update docs -> ongoing
HVAC
- loop level API
    - loop builder done for plant loop
- branch level API
    - build a branch with a list of components -> close to done -> DONE
    - replace existing branch with new branch -> close to done -> DONE
- component level API
    - branch level API can be used to do this -> discuss -> DONE
-----------
Background work done:
- put GPL license in all code files
- unit tests updated so that tests can be done with any version of IDD. 
This was hard coded earlier with IDD snippets embedded in the test. Different test were using different versions of IDD.

tasks to be done:
- complete items that are close to done
- finish up remaining functions
- update docs
- traversing the loop
- clean up the github branches so that you can send the link to anyone.
- JUNE end as completion.

some thoughts:
- need a good way of calling things:
    - "ZONE" = objkey ?
    - "Plenum" = anobject ?
- how to deal with case in the fields
    - some fields are case sensitive
    - case should be retained
    - comparisons should be case insensitive, except in retaincase
    - need to find if retaincase is true.
- need philosophy on this:
    - I have 3 levels of editing
    - lowest is -> data, commdct
    - mid -> bunchdt
    - high -> IDF

when you rename nodes do:
obj.nodefield = [oldnodename, newodename]
Then you can find the occurance of the old names in other places.

loopname = "p_loop"
sloop = ['sb0', ['sb1', 'sb2', 'sb3'], 'sb4']
dloop = ['db0', ['db1', 'db2', 'db3'], 'db4']

constr.Layer_5 = 'B52' # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt
constr["Layer_5"] = 'B52' # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt

    Plan an appropriate response for each of the above.

L = constr.Layer_5 # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt
    # return None ?
    # return '' ? -> maybe this one ? # DONE this
    # throw exception ? 
L = constr["Layer_5"] # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt
    # same as above
    # DONE as above
L = constr.Layer5 # there is a typo in the field name
    # Throw exception "BadEPFieldError"
    # DONE
L = constr["Layer5"] # there is a typo in the field name
    # Throw exception "BadEPFieldError"
    # DONE
constr.Layer_5 = 'B52' # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt
    # you should be able to put a value in.
    # if Layer_4 also does not exit, make it ''. 
    # DONE
constr["Layer_5"] = 'B52' # Layer_5 may not exist in data.dt

Bad News
- Issue of node following in HVAC
- it has not been possible to come up with a generic node-following code.
- will speak about this on call
- 
- have not explored 3-D API (such as resizing windows)
2013-04-23

write the following functions
- rename
- import one
- import attached
- find attached
- find reference
- check obj equal

fuck ... I am trying to make this too complicated.
Keep it simple.
model, toprint, idd_info = idfreader(fname1, iddfile)
toprint = is the real model
model = allows you to access objects and change fields
    it does not allow you to add or delete objects
----
class IDF
idf = IDF(iddfilename)
model = idf.read(idffilename)
print model
str(model)
CRUD
model.create("ZONE", "zonename") # will be last zone in list of zones
model.read -> azone = model.objects["ZONE"][0]
model.update -> azone.Name="gumby"
model.delete(azone)

Agenda for call
- Status of pyenergyplus
- Next updates
- timeline
- Contractual issues

State of pyenergyplus:
----------------------
- Object API is complete
- Geometry API is complete
- HTML Table output reader complete
- Example files to illustrate API use is complete

Next updates:
two possibilities:
(time and resources may be enough for only one of the following)
1. streamline install and usage:
    - full install thru pip using the following command
        - pip install energyplus 
    - maybe restructure or code to make it simpler for a first time user.
2. Cookbook of recipes
    - Use the EEM list from this project to generate recipes.
    - Additional functions may be added to the API to facilitate the recipes
    
Contractual Issues
------------------
Contract asks for a report at each stage. What should I do for this.
How should I stage this ?


do a name change API
resizes window. 
3D-API
hmtl table -> better example
import.
node following code.
reference following code.
more examples
call in two weeks.

TODO.
draft of documentation.
node following code.
reference following code.

code review with Tuan and Nathan

2012-11-25
----------
some tasks in sequence.
1. factor the code in iddgaps.py
it is hard to make sense of it now.

2. Also it is not filling the gaps in all objects.
update to fix this

3. Once above is done, use it in bunch2data.py

Notes from conference call with Jason Glazer:
- Scripting library to be called PyEnergyplus
- Jason needs to use the software to generate files for the following criteria:
	1. internal loads (people, lights, process, schedules etc.)
	2. envelope (skin, construction, windows size, shading elements etc.)
	3. Climate
	4. Geometry
	5. HVAC
- All of the above except Climate can be done by pyenergyplus object API
- climate/weather file should be changed during the energy simulation
- To do this we need to be able to run energyplus from pyenergyplus
- then look at the results and be able to another run
- It would be useful to get a signal back from energyplus, when the simulation is complete

The tasks to be completed are:
1. Object API
2. Geometry API
3. Output Reader
4. HVAC API (beyond the Object API)
5. Documentation (code docs, user docs, tutorial)

Of the above we have proof of concept for 1, 2, 3.

Schedule:
- Dec 15th
	- Object API
	- corresponding user docs
- Jan 21st
	- Object API (any updates)
	- Geometry API
	- Output reader (atleast for ABUPS)
	- corresponding user docs
